### 📜 Problem Description

Given string num representing a non-negative integer  `num` , and an integer  `k` , return  *the smallest possible integer after removing*   `k`   *digits from*   `num` .

**Example 1:**

```
Input: num = "1432219", k = 3
Output: "1219"
Explanation: Remove the three digits 4, 3, and 2 to form the new number 1219 which is the smallest.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: num = "10200", k = 1
Output: "200"
Explanation: Remove the leading 1 and the number is 200. Note that the output must not contain leading zeroes.

```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: num = "10", k = 2
Output: "0"
Explanation: Remove all the digits from the number and it is left with nothing which is 0.

```

**Constraints:**

	
- `1 <= k <= num.length <= 105`
	
- `num`  consists of only digits.
	
- `num`  does not have any leading zeros except for the zero itself.
