### 📜 Problem Description

You are given the  `head`  of a linked list containing unique integer values and an integer array  `nums`  that is a subset of the linked list values.

Return the number of  **connected**   **components**  in  `nums` . A connected component is a non-empty, maximal sequence of  **consecutive**  nodes in the linked list such that every node's value belongs to nums.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: head = [0,1,2,3], nums = [0,1,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: 0 and 1 are connected, so [0, 1] and [3] are the two connected components.

```

**Example 2:**

 ![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/22/lc-linkedlistcom2.jpg) 

```
Input: head = [0,1,2,3,4], nums = [0,3,1,4]
Output: 2
Explanation: 0 and 1 are connected, 3 and 4 are connected, so [0, 1] and [3, 4] are the two connected components.

```

**Constraints:**

	
- The number of nodes in the linked list is  `n` .
	
- `1 <= n <= 104`
	
- `0 <= Node.val < n`
	
- All the values  `Node.val`  are  **unique** .
	
- `1 <= nums.length <= n`
	
- `0 <= nums[i] < n`
	
- All the values of  `nums`  are  **unique** .
